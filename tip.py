'''
Well, we’ve written most of a tip calculator for you. Unfortunately, we didn’t have time to implement two functions:

dollars_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as $##.##, wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the leading $, and return the amount as a float. For instance, given $50.00 as input, it should return 50.0.

percent_to_float, which should accept a str as input (formatted as ##%, wherein each # is a decimal digit), remove the trailing %, and return the percentage as a float. For instance, given 15% as input, it should return 0.15.

Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats.

Hints
    -Recall that input returns a str, per docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#input.
    -Recall that float can convert a str to a float, per docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float.
    -Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.
